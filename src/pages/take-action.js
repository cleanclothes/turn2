                    <p>In 2013 H&amp;M committed to ensuring living wages by 2018, which brought the brand a lot of positive media coverage. Now H&amp;M is trying to cover up that commitment, pretending they have been saying something else all along.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile hundreds of thousands of workers making H&amp;M clothing still cannot lift themselves out of poverty with the hard work hidden behind the glossy storefronts. </p>
                    <p>H&amp;M has the financial¬†means and the power to stay true to their original commitment. Not only that ‚Äì they could even go beyond that and cover their whole supply chain. </p>
                    <p>You have a voice in determining H&amp;M‚Äôs course of action!¬†</p>
