Five years have passed since H&M unveiled its living wage road map and promised that 850,000 workers would be paid a living wage by 2018. Yet, workers recently revealed poverty wages and labour rights violations in factories that were covered by that promise. Enough is enough! More than 130,000 people have already made a clear and urgent demand: You need help to put this in practice, H&M? Below is a list of key measures and specific demands to get you going in the right direction, right away!
